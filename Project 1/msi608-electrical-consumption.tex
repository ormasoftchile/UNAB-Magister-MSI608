\begin{abstract}
    In central Chile, electricity demand has significantly increased due to factors
    like population growth, industrial expansion, and climate change, which affects consumption
    patterns. This project aims to predict the electrical consumption of several key substations,
    starting with Alto Jahuel, to better understand demand and improve energy planning.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\paragraph{Background} \PARstart{T}{he} electrical consumption of several key substations in Central 
Chile is a critical factor in energy planning. Electricity is a non-storable product, so accurate
 forecasting helps avoid issues with excessive production or those caused by lacking production.
  Power Load Forecasting (PLF) is classified in terms of the planning horizon’s duration: up to 1
   day/week ahead for short-term, 1 day/week to 1 year ahead for medium-term, and more than 1 year
    ahead for long-term \cite{b1}.

\paragraph{Research question} Devise a model to forecast the electrical consumption of several 
key substations in Central Chile, to better understand demand and improve energy planning. 
Electricity is non storable product, so accurate forecasting helps avoid issues with excessive 
production or those caused by lacking production. Power Load Forecasting is classified in terms
 of horizon: short term, mid term and long term. \footnote{The EPLF is classified in terms of
the planning horizon’s duration: up to 1 day/week ahead for short-term, 1 day/week to 1 year
ahead for medium-term, and more than 1 year ahead for long-term} \footnote{Excepteur sint,
sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.}

\paragraph{Answer to the question} Demand for electricity is influenced by a variety of factors, including population growth, industrial expansion, and climate change. The project aims to predict the electrical consumption of several key substations, starting with Alto Jahuel, to better understand demand and improve energy planning. Accurate prediction will allow electric companies to optimize energy distribution, improve efficiency, and reduce the risk of overloads and blackouts.

\paragraph{ARIMA} The ARIMA models and their variants are the most widely used models for time series forecasting. The ARIMA model is a generalization of the ARMA model, which is a generalization of the AR model and the MA model. The AR model is a linear regression model that uses the dependent relationship between an observation and some number of lagged observations. The MA model is a linear regression model that uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations. The ARMA model combines both the AR and MA models. The ARIMA model adds differencing of the observations to make the time series stationary, which is a key requirement of the model.

\section{Study objective}\label{s:section}

The objective of this project is to accurately predict electricity consumption at the central Chile substations using machine learning techniques to improve the responsiveness of the electric system to demand fluctuations.

\caption{Train data for consumption by substation}
\label{fig:figure_consumption_by_substation}
\end{figure}

\section{Methodology}\label{s:methodology}

The methodology is based on the canonical machine learning pipeline. Regarding the model selection, a glimpse over \cite{MS15} and \cite{MS19} is recommended.
The methodology for the current project consists of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Data collection: The data was collected from the central Chile substations.	
\item Data preprocessing: The data was preprocessed to remove any missing values and outliers.
\item Feature engineering: The data was transformed into features that could be used by the machine learning model.
\item Model selection: The model was selected based on its performance on the training data.
\item Model training: The model was trained on the training data.
\item Model evaluation: The model was evaluated on the test data.
% \item Model deployment: The model was deployed to predict the electrical consumption of the central Chile substations.
% \item Model monitoring: The model was monitored to ensure that it continued to perform well over time.
% \item Model updating: The model was updated as needed to improve its performance.
% \item Model maintenance: The model was maintained to ensure that it continued to perform well.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experiments}\label{s:experiments}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{consumption_distribution}
    \caption{Consumption distribution}
    \label{fig:figure_consumption_distribution}
    \end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Data analysis
    \begin {enumerate}
        \item {Data quality}: There are no missing values in the data.
        \item Data distribution: See \ref{fig:figure_consumption_distribution}. 
        \item Data visualization: See FIGURE 1 for visualizing the consumption by substation. For each plot we can appreciate there seems to be a cyclic pattern in the data that repeats every year.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Descriptive statistics: See Table \ref{tab:table_substations}. For the BUIN substation, the standard
    deviation is very low. The extreme values -199 and 6.633003 appear as outliers, so they are going to be removed.
    \item Relevant graphs

The experiments were conducted using the Alto Jahuel substation data. 
The data was split into training and test sets, with 80\% of the data used for training and 20\%
 used for testing. The model was trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data.
 The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure_consumption_by_substation}.

\section{Publication Principles}
The two types of contents of that are published are; 1) peer-reviewed and 2) 
archival. The Access Department publishes scholarly 
articles of archival value as well as tutorial expositions and critical 
reviews of classical subjects and topics of current interest. 

Authors should consider the following points:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Technical papers submitted for publication must advance the state of knowledge and must cite relevant prior work. 
\item The length of a submitted paper should be commensurate with the importance, or appropriate to the complexity, of the work. For example, an obvious extension of previously published work might not be appropriate for publication or might be adequately treated in just a few pages.
\item Authors must convince both peer reviewers and the editors of the scientific and technical merit of a paper; the standards of proof are higher when extraordinary or unexpected results are reported. 
\item Because replication is required for scientific progress, papers submitted for publication must provide sufficient information to allow readers to perform similar experiments or calculations and 
use the reported results. Although not everything need be disclosed, a paper 
must contain new, useable, and fully described information. For example, a 
specimen's chemical composition need not be reported if the main purpose of 
a paper is to introduce a new measurement technique. Authors should expect 
to be challenged by reviewers if the results are not supported by adequate 
data and critical details.
\item Papers that describe ongoing work or announce the latest technical achievement, which are suitable for presentation at a professional conference, may not be appropriate for publication.
\end{enumerate}
